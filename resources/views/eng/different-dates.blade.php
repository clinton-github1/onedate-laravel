<p>When Jesus sees Christians celebrating His Passion, Death and Resurrection twice almost every year, in a mystical way Jesus suffers to see such divisions among His Family for which He died and suffered to make them one Family.</p>

<p>It may well serve the reader of this website, in his or her own interest to research some of the reasons that are understood in relation to two Easter dates existing, however the main aim of this website is to provide evidence regarding the people of Christâ€™s mystical body, the Church and the desire to act as a leverage of change. That change is anticipated to be a step towards Church unity.</p>
