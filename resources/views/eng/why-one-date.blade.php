<h1>Why Sign the Petition to Celebrate Easter all in one date?</h1>
<p>Simply, because as one Christian family we are divided on this matter and our division is a sin. When we cannot agree to celebrate the Feast of the Resurrection on the same day, how can we hope to be a sign of Peace and Unity to the world?</p>

<p>“I appeal to you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no dissensions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment.” (1 Cor 1:10 RSV)</p>

<p>“But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, <b style="color:#ea1951">Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth”</b>(Lk 11:17 AKJV)</p>

<p><b style="color:#ea1951">“I do not pray for these only, but also for those who believe in me through their word, that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.”</b> (Jn 17:20 - 21 RSV)</p>

<p>“Whoever knows what is right to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.” (James 4:17 RSV)</p>
