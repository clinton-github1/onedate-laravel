<h1>Our sin of division as Christians</h1>
<p>The Resurrection is at the centre of the Christian faith, without it there is no Christianity, however, <b>almost every year Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox celebrate Easter on different dates</b>, some years as much as five weeks apart and other years on the same date.</p>

<p>This division among Christians in celebrating this Feast of Feasts is a great sin and Christians all know that division does not come from God.</p>
